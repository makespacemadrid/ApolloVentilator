  /* To update the value of a progress bar you can use the writeNum() function
   * writeNum("j0.val", 55); set the value of j0(object Name) to 55
   * writeNum("j0.val", volt); set the value of j0(object Name) equal with the value of volt variable
  */
  
  /* To make a vertical progress bar set the **dez** attribute to vertical 
   * And change the values of width and height of the progress bar.
   */
  
  /* To reverse the direction of progress bar where the default in horizontal is: left to right
   * and down to up in vertical align, subtract the value from 100 and reverse the colors
   * of foreground and background between them
   */   
   
   /* There is no need to send the value from Arduino straight to the progress bar with writeNum();
    * as most times the progress bar is not the only component on a page that must be updated
    * usually the display of the value on a box also needed 
    * On some cases a  change of color on a box or on progress bar also needed when value reach a point.
    * As the value of the progress bar must be re-mapped to 0-100 and in order to not send the same value multiple times
    * with different formats and limit the data from Serial, use the advantages of Nextion graphics to
    * create a variable and save there the value you want to appear in the progress bar.
    * Use the features provided by Nextion via the user code on a timer to update the progress bar 
    * and at the same time display the value or whatever else you need.
