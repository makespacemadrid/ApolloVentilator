  // As these commands are using Serial to read and write, 
  // it is more preferred not to run them in the loop() without delay(); 
  // or some other method of not running them with the frequency of the loop
  // and use them only when it is needed.
  // A delay in the loop can be noticed, especially when reading from Serial
  // And of course to avoid a Serial buffer overflow
