 /* This example aims to show how you can use and manage single waveform
  * on Nextion displays. As an example we are going to display the value of an analog input.
  * With the same way you can manage more than one channels or waveforms
  */
  
  /* Every waveform can have up to 4 channels. They are numbered from 0 to 3
   * Don't mistake the number of channels with the ID of the channel
   * ID is 0 for the first channel, 1 for the second, 2 for the third, 3 for the fourth  
  */
  //********** Waveform's channel data range is min 0 max 255 **********
  //         **** A re-map of value range must de done ****
  /* The command to Add single value to Waveform Channel is:
   * add <waveform>,<channel>,<value>
   * <waveform> is the .id of the waveform component
   * <channel> is the channel the data will be added to
   * <value> is ASCII text of data value, or numeric value
   */
   
   /* TIP: Waveform 1 pixel column used for every data value added on x - axis
    * on y - axis as the Data range is from 0 to 255 the height of waveform must be 255 pixel
    * in order to have a represent of zero to the lower point and 255 to the higher point of the waveform
    * If the height of the waveform is not 255 pixel use the * dis * attribute for scaling the data from 10 to 1000%
    * if waveform has a height of 127 pixel set data scaling * dis * to 50. Set dis to 200 for 510 pixel waveform height
    * You can use this math type < dis = 100*(waveform height in pixels)/255 >
    */
   
   /* There is no need to send from Arduino the command add <waveform>,<channel>,<value>
    * as most times the waveform is not the only component on a page that must be updated
    * usually the display of the value on a box also needed 
    * On some cases a  change of color on a box also needed when value reach a point.
    * As the value to waveform must be re-mapped to 0-255 and in order to not send the same value multiple times
    * with different formats and limit the data from Serial, use the advantages of Nextion graphics to
    * create a variable and save there the value you want to appear in the waveform.
    * Use the features provided by Nextion via the user code on a timer to update the waveform 
    * and at the same time display the value or whatever else you need
