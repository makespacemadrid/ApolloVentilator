/* trigger() is the most important method of the library. 
 * And this is because, it gives you the ability to use the predefined functions and run your code from there. 
 * These predefined functions are named trigger1(), trigger2(), trigger3()... up to trigger50(). 
 * You can use them as a simple void out of the loop, in which you will have written a block of code to run every time it is called.
 * You can call those trigger() functions and run the code they contain anytime by simply writing in a Nextion Event the command:
 * `printh 23 02 54 XX` , where `XX` the id for the triggerXX() in HEX.
 * Example: printh 23 02 54 01 to call trigger1() ... printh 23 02 54 0A to call trigger10() and so on...
